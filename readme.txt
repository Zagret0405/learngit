Hello, here is my first git project.
Git is a kind of version management tool/kit, I assume.
Actually,
Git is a distributed version control system.
Git is a free software distributed under the GPL.
Git has a mutable index called stage.
Git tracks changes of files.
Creating a new branch is quick and simple.
I have a dev branch from now on.
I create hello.py(not finished), but i need fix a bug right now.
